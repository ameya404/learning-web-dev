<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<p> 1-1/2 cups sugar, divided <br> 
    6 large eggs <br> 
    3 cups whole milk <br> 
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract <br> </p>
<h2> Procedure <br> </h2> 
<h3> Step 1 <br> </h3>
<p> In a large heavy saucepan, cook and stir 3/4 cup sugar over low heat until sugar is melted and golden. Pour into eight 6-oz. custard cups, tilting to coat bottom of cup; let stand for 10 minutes. <br> </p>
<h3> Step 2 <br> </h3>
<p> In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, vanilla and remaining sugar until blended but not foamy. Pour over caramelized sugar. <br> </p>
<h3> Step 3 <br> </h3>
<p> Place the cups in two 8-in. square baking pans. Pour very hot water in pans to a depth of 1 in. Bake at 350Â° until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40-45 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks. <br> </p>
<h3> Step 4 <br> </h3> 
<p> Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes completely on wire rack. <br> </p>
<h3> Step 5 <br> </h3>
<p> To unmold, run a knife around rim of cup and invert onto dessert place. Serve warm or chilled. <br> </p>
